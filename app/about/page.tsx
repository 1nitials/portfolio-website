                i made this website to have a better view of my works throughout the years, 
                and to easily show it to other people if needed. i hope to redesign
                this down the line when i actually figure out how i want my "portfolio" website
                to ACTUALLY look.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 text-xs mb-16">
                i say "portfolio" because i also want this to be my personal site, which explains a lot since i want this
                site to also be a good representation of who i am
              </p>
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-600">
                but in the meantime, have some minimalist slop lol
