            i made this website to have a better view of my works, 
            and to easily show it to other people (thus the github-styled layout). i hope to redesign
            this down the line when i actually figure out how i want my "portfolio" website
            to ACTUALLY look. i say "portfolio" because i also want this to be my personal site.

            but in the meantime, have some minimalist slop lol
